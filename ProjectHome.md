I run a lot of meetings where we raffle off prizes at the end of the meeting. The problem is that any automated tool we try to use that works off the people that RSVP for the meeting takes forever to use. First of all, half the people either don't show up or leave before we conduct the raffle. Secondly, there is the inevitable logjam over prize selection when there are multiple options to choose from. Twaffle addresses both of these issues. Only those in attendance just prior to start of the raffle are given info to send an SMS from their phone indicating which prize they are interested in. That way, the randomly selected winner(s) are guaranteed to be in attendance and the prize they win is pre-determined by them as part of entering the raffle. Only the designated (admin) phone can send the SMS initiating the raffle winner selection. Winners are then notified via SMS message and can come up to select their prize. This is done using a combination of Kynetx and Twilio cloud services with the raffle data stored on Google App Engine.
